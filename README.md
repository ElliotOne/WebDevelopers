# WebDevelopers
 WebDevelopers or WebDevs was my first idea to create a platform for clients to outsource their programming projects to young programmers, especially computer engineering students so that they can invlove in real-world software development and have an income source while studying.
 
 ** However, due to discontinuation of members cooperation in the WebDevelopers group, I never used this project in real-life. This project is only a UI design and a Telegram bot implementation, which they indicate a proof of concept. **


## Parts

### Front-End
This section is supposed to be visible to the general public and clients can fill in the corresponding form to describe their project at hand and outsource their project.

### Users Panel
This panel is both used by the clients and developers who can access the available projects and manage their project requests.

### Admin Panel
Admin panel is only accessible for the administartors of the platform and they have full control over the platform.

### Telegram bot

Another importantr aspect of this project, is a fully functioning telegram bot with complete authentication that users can outsource their projects through the bot and track their project from there. ** This is the only part of the project which is implemented completely and has a backend. **
